<p>My research focuses on unravelling the elements geochemical behaviours in magmatic-hydrothermal systems. It integrates advanced synchrotron in-situ X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) techniques, thermodynamic modelling, and numerical simulations to investigate the mechanisms of ore formation under high-T/P conditions. I am passionate about advancing the frontiers of economic geology and look forward to contributing further to the scientific community through both theoretical and practical innovations.</p>
